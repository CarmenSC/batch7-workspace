# Coding test


Welcome to the Coding test.

The first thing you need to do is to setup your local environment, so that you can run the notebook with the coding test.


### Setup your local environment

If you've already done SLU01, you should know what to do.

Otherwise, you need to:
* Have Python 3 installed in your machine.
* Create a Python virtual environment.
* Install the requirements listed in the `requirements.txt`, in your virtual env (note: it is paramount that the packages that you install have the exact same version as in the `requirements.txt` file, because those are the versions that we're using to grade your notebooks).
* Be able to open a Jupyter Notebook and run code there.

If you need more detailed instructions than these, please check the README in SLU01.


### Submitting your work for grading

You've downloaded a zip file with the coding test from the portal [here](https://admissions.lisbondatascience.org/candidate/coding-test).

In order to pass the test, you have to solve the exercises from the Notebook, submit them for grading and get a score of at least 16 (out of 20).

> In the submissions file uploader, you should upload **only the Exercise Notebook with your solutions**. You don't need to create a zip file or anything else!

After you submit your Exercise Notebook, you'll see the grade of your submission, and whether you passed or not.
You can click "Open" in the feedback column to see how much you scored in each question.

While the test countdown is on, you can make as many submissions as you like :)
